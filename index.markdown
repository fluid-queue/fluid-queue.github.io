A queue system for Super Mario Maker 2 levels.

This project is based on Queso Queue Plus, which was originally developed by Shoujo (<https://github.com/ToransuShoujo/quesoqueue_plus/>) and diceguyd30 (<https://github.com/diceguyd30/queso_to_go_template>).

To get started with the bot, check out the [setup instructions](/native-setup), or the [Docker instructions](/docker-setup) if you'd rather use Docker.
